Also, my program of choice is R, so most materials will be created using R/RStudio/RMarkdown (maybe even bookdown if necessitated by complexity). However, I hope to extend this foundation to a more comprehensive approach to research. For now, I will include several small-scale aspects which may come in handy for some. Perhaps not, only time will tell.\nTruth to the matter, this repository will help me consolidate skills and code that I have developed. In doing that, I will be able to return to these documents whenever needed in the future and have a how-to manual written by me, for me. :)\n\n\nWhile there are many resources for help in research and there is no true “one-size-fits-all” approach, there are similarities in approaches.\nParticular attention will be given to topics of data analysis and results presentation, but I may include some other topics such as: - Project conceptualization - Project management / scheduling - Literature review - Data collection - Discussion of significance and implications\nAnything that can help in any one of these aspects (or many) might be found in this collection."

    "section": "Structuring",
    "text": "Structuring\nI will attempt to section out the materials into three levels: 1. Beginner 2. Intermediate 3. Advanced\nIn general, the Beginner documents will have a single task and/or skill associated with them, while the Intermediate and Advanced materials will be built in a hierarchical fashion. That is, an Intermediate or Advanced document will likely combine two or more code-sets / tasks / skills into one cohesive document. For example, the Intermediate document Analyzing a Continuous Response Variable could contain skills / code covered in simpler Beginner documents such as Visualizing a Continuous Variable, Calculating a Correlation Coefficient, or Fitting a Simple Linear Regression Model. I will try and back-reference simpler documents, but it is possible that skills / code included in higher level materials will be more unique to task and not directly pulled from simpler documents.\nFurthermore, the structuring of the subfolders within each skill-level archive will be inherently different. For Beginner materials, I will try to partition / categorize documents appropriately, e.g., Data Visualization or Data Analysis. However, as the Intermediate and Advanced materials will combine multiple skills / tasks / code found in the Beginner documents, the categorization may be insufficient / inaccurate. So, higher-level materials will not likely be similarly categorized.\nFair warning, my mind is random and this will likely manifest in the structure / materials found within the repo.\n\nIncluded Materials\nI will attempt to maintain a Table of Contents as a separate document. Consult this for a comprehensive list of included documents in the Journal of Walkthroughs."
