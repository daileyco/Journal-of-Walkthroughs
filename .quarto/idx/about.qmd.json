Also, my program of choice is R, so most materials will be created using R/RStudio/RMarkdown (maybe even bookdown if necessitated by complexity).

That is, an `Intermediate` or `Advanced` document will likely combine two or more code-sets / tasks / skills into one cohesive document. For example, the `Intermediate` document *Analyzing a Continuous Response Variable* could contain skills / code covered in simpler `Beginner` documents such as *Visualizing a Continuous Variable*, *Calculating a Correlation Coefficient*, or *Fitting a Simple Linear Regression Model*. I will try and back-reference simpler documents, but it is possible that skills / code included in higher level materials will be more unique to task and not directly pulled from simpler documents. \n\nFurthermore, the structuring of the subfolders within each skill-level archive will be inherently different. For `Beginner` materials, I will try to partition / categorize documents appropriately, e.g., **Data Visualization** or **Data Analysis**. However, as the `Intermediate` and `Advanced` materials will combine multiple skills / tasks / code found in the `Beginner` documents, the categorization may be insufficient / inaccurate. So, higher-level materials will not likely be similarly categorized. \n\nFair warning, my mind is random and this will likely manifest in the structure / materials found within the repo. \n\n\n### Included Materials\n\nI will attempt to maintain a `Table of Contents` as a separate document.
