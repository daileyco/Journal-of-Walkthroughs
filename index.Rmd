# Welcome! Bienvenue! Bienvenidos! Willkommen! Bem-vindos! {.unlisted .unnumbered}


This is the ***Journal of Walkthroughs***, aka my version of those data science blogs you will find all over the internet / a way for me to play around with creating websites.


## Content

Check out **About** for a little more detail on what you can expect to find. 

Check out **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, **Advanced** sections for the *walkthroughs*. 




## Contributing

If you have a document that you think fits this general purpose / design or would like to create one, feel free to reach out to me and we can discuss adding it to the repository. If I remember, I will create a `Beginner` document containing information on the structuring / outline of *Walkthroughs* that I would like to remain consistent.
