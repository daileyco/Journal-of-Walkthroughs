## Overview
While there are many resources for help in research and there is no true "one-size-fits-all" approach, there are similarities in approaches. 

These may include, but are not limited to: 
- Project conceptualization
- Project management / scheduling
- Literature review
- Data collection
- Data analysis
- Results presentation
- Discussion of significance and implications

My goal with this repository (aptly named "Journal of Walkthroughs") is to provide a collection of general-use, reusable, and technical documentation which may help anyone in the odyssey of research. My focus is on data analysis and my program of choice is R. However, I hope to extend this foundation to a more comprehensive approach to research. For now, I will include several small-scale aspects which may come in handy for some. Perhaps not, only time will tell.   

Happy researching!
